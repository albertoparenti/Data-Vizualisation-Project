# Data Visualization

## Dataset Description

We chose to work with a dataset containing data from Reddit, a social media platform that allows users to post and comment on content. The different communities that exist on Reddit are organized into groups called subreddits. A subreddit is formed around a specific subject, which can be general (such as science or movies) or veryspecific (such as bonsai trees or helping to identify typefaces).

The dataset we selected contains almost 5 years of data from Reddit, specifically, it contains data from Reddit posts which link to other subr eddits, including the source and target subreddits, the postâ€™s timestamp, sentiment score and many other characteristics of the post. This subreddit-to-subreddit hyperlink network allows us to explore how different subreddits are connected, as well as the different characteristics of each subreddit.
